# Tank Trivia

This was a project worked on by myself and a partner. This was my first big project, and I tried reinventing the wheel in regards to so much of this project. This will become appearant when the font loader and displayer loads in. Some assets used for this project are not mine and were created by a friend, namely [Music.wav](/res/Music.wav), so other than that, all assets of this project are available to anyone who'd like to use them.

The point of this game is to answer World War II questions in-order to get ammo to fight the bosses, being three thanks, each themed with a major Axis Power during the second World War.
